## Technologies Used

In this UI there are three cards.From the three cards the second card is above the other two cards.
I used box-shadows to describe the difference between them.
### Challanges and Solutions 
I faced lot of challenge while creating this UI as it is my second project using HTML and CSS. After few tries I just fixed it own.And this UI is only for PC.In future I'll just fix it to compaitable with all devices.
